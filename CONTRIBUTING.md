## Pull Requests (PRs)

- PR will be reviewed within a maximum of 24 hours of submitting the request.
- The following rules are to be followed while submitting a PR:-
	- <strong>Branch Name</strong>: The name of the branch should start with 'in' followed by hyphen (-) and the issue number. Eg:- If you are working on issue number 57 then your branch name should be in-57. You need to make sure that in your fork you create a branch following this pattern.
	- <strong>Commit Message</strong>: Commit message should make sense, anyone should be able to get an idea of what changes were made in that particular commit. Irrelevant or inapporpriate commit messages are highly discouraged.
	- <strong>Docstrings</strong>: Docstrings are special comments in python which helps one to understand what a function or class does, the parameters passed, and the data returned from that function. We tend to follow a similar syntax for javascript too, we expect everyone to adhere to the format in your code. To get a better idea of the format of docstrings, please refer to the codebase.
	- <strong>Comments</strong>: The comments should be meaningful and one should be able to understand what the line(s) of code mean from the comments. Do not add unecessary comments in each line, leave out comments from code which is self-explanatory. 
	- <strong>Variables</strong>: Variable names used in your code should explain what the variable is. Some unacceptable variable names are:- a, b, hello, world, etc.  While creating variable name with multiple words in it, the words should be separated by underscore (_) e.g:- player_initial_energy and should not be written in camel case e.g- playerInitialEnergy.
- Failing to adhere to any of the above mentioned rules will lead to closing of your PR by a maintainer.
- After successful submission of PR, it will be subjected to automated testing and if the code fails any of the tests you will be given a time period of 3 days to fix the issue, else your PR will be closed.

## New Issue (New feature or bug)

- The time period for reviewing of a new issue is a maximum of 36 hours, you can expect to hear from a maintainer within this/
- The implementation of the new feature or fixing of the bug should only be started after a maintainer approves the feature or bug report in the discussion. 
- Once approved start implementing the feature or fix the bug and submit a pull request.

## Unit Testing

- Make sure you test your code using the inbuilt testing before you make a PR. 
- To test your code, the steps are as follows:-
	1) Navigate to the repository using terminal or command prompt (in windows).
	2) Change directory to test
	```bash
	user@programmer~:$ cd test/
	```
  3) Run main.py
	```bash
	user@programmer~:$ python main.py
	```
  4) If any test fails make sure to fix your code so that the error goes away. PR will be deleted if it does not pass the tests. 
  
## Instructions for first time contributors/ beginner level contributors for template related issues (both HTML and LATEX) during HACKTOBERFEST

- Start working on the issues once you are assigned to them. Head over to the issue and comment that you want it to be assigned to you. Once the maintainer assigns the issue to you, start working on it.
- Once the issue is assigned, you have one week (7 Days) to submit the PR. Failing to do so will get the issue reassigned to someone else. As each issue related to questions are being assigned to single contributor at a time, we sincerely hope that you cooperate with us.
- If you create a PR without the issue being assigned to you, the PR will be marked spam as you are not adhering to the rules.   
- For the template related files:
	- if it is a HTML template, name the files as template<template_number>.html and template<template_number>.css and put them in the respective folders in TemplateBuddy/static/resume_templates i.e. html and css folder. Eg. template2.html and template2.css   
	- if it is a LaTeX template, put the source files in a folder named as template<template_number> and put that folder in the location TemplateBuddy/static/resume_templates/tex as a zip file. Eg. template2.zip
- If the files are not named in the above mentioned format, a comemnt would be added by the maintainers as a warning and if it is not changed in the next PR, the PR would be marked spam for not adhering to the rules.
